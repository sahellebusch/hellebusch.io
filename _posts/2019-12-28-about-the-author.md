Iâ€™m Sean, a beer drinking software engineer, husband, and dad to two doggos with an enthusiasm for the outdoors, fitness, and food. I grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri and attended college at Truman State University. After migrating to Kansas City for work, and meeting my wonderful wife, Kelly, we picked up our life and headed to the Pacific Northwest. Portland is where we now call home.

I currently work at [Hinge Health](https://hingehealth.com/) where we are working to change the way people understand and think about pain. We aim to deliver best practice care that improves chronic pain without drugs or surgery.
